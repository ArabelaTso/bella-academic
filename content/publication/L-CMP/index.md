abstract: This demo introduces L-CMP, an automatic learning-based parameterized verification tool. It can verify parameterized protocols by combining machine learning and model checking techniques. Given a parameterized protocol, L-CMP learns a set of auxiliary invariants and implements verification of the protocol using the invariants automatically. In particular, the learned auxiliary invariants are straightforward and readable. The experimental results show that L-CMP can successfully verify a number of cache coherence protocols, including the industrial-scale FLASH protocol.
